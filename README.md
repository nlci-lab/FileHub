### Universal File Transformation Module for NLCI

---

## 🏢 About the Project

**FileHub** is a custom-built file utility system developed for the **NLCI Organization**.

As a fully computerized organization, NLCI handles **hundreds of digital files daily** across multiple departments, formats, and workflows. Managing, converting, organizing, and processing these files efficiently became a critical operational requirement.

Generic file tools were either:
- Not flexible enough for NLCI’s workflow
- Too slow for batch processing
- Lacking automation support
- Not customizable to internal systems

To solve this, **FileHub** was designed as a **lightweight, effective, and fully customizable file toolset** tailored specifically for NLCI's digital infrastructure.
